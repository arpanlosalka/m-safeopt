# M-SafeOPT
Accompanying code for the paper "No-Regret Algorithms for Safe Bayesian Optimization with Monotonicity Constraints" (AISTATS 2024)

Please use the Safe_Bayesian_Optimization.ipynb file for experimenting with the M-SafeOPT algorithm(s) and baselines, and the MSafeOpt_Memory_Efficient.ipynb file for a more memory-efficient implementation of M-SafeOPT.
